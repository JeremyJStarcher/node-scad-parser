# node-scad-parser
Module to parse the abstract syntax tree of OpenSCAD files

## Attention
This is still **beta stage**, at the moment I'm busy porting the code from JS to TS.

## Commands
* ```npm run generate-docs```: Generate the documentation files
* ```npm run live-test```: Run unit tests and run again on file changes
* ```npm test```: Run unit tests and generate coverage report

## Credits
* Thanks to the OpenSCAD team for this great programmatic CAD tool: [OpenSCAD](https://github.com/openscad/openscad)
